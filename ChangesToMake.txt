WILL NOT BE DONE: 
* About PurofMovio:
 1) Include the name of the tunable parameters for PUROFMOVIO controller.
 2) It would be interesting to know the runs number carried out in the parameters adjustment, as well as the 
standard deviations obtained in these parameters.

* "With respect to the previous work, the authors added a real-time component of the game" ? WHAT?? Check this. No. He read it wrong.
* Will you run the competition again? If 
so, how will you avoid the perception that this is a rather complicated game task to understand and write a 
controller for? Do you think the fact that the team writing the winning controller collaborates closely with 
the team organising the competition is a potential problem, for example in that it might dissuade independent 
competitors from participating? THE ANSWER IS NO.
* Section III. THE MO-PTSP FRAMEWORK could perhaps be shortened a bit, especially subsection A, which 
contains information that is of less scientific interest than the rest of the paper. (It is also my
understanding that this information could be found on web pages and in other published papers.) This 
could leave room for more discussion on the organisation of the competition.
* The competition was very decisively won. This highlights the quality of the winning controller, but also the 
fact that very few participants submitted controllers to the competition. I think the paper deserves a mention 
of this, and perhaps some analysis of why more people did not submit.
